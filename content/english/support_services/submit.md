The Swedish Research Council and SciLifeLab has signed the Wellcome Trust statement on
[Sharing research data and findings relevant to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak](https://wellcome.ac.uk/coronavirus-covid-19/open-data),
that among other things state that signees ensure that:

> _"researchers share interim and final research data relating to the outbreak, together with protocols and standards used to collect the data, as rapidly and widely as possible - including with public health and research communities and the WHO"._

To live up to this and make your Covid-19 research data useful and accessible for the rest of the research community it should be published in a public repository together with descriptive metadata.
For data types where a  suitable international repository is available, your data should be submitted there, if no such repository exist, your data can be deposited in the [General data repository](../general_data_repository).

[NBIS](http://www.nbis.se/) can support you with Data Management Planning early on in the projects to make data sharing more efficient, both through [personal consultations](https://nbis.se/support/supportform/index.php?form=consultation) and by providing a [customised tool](https://dsw.scilifelab.se/) to create Data Management Plans.
We can also assist you in identifying relevant repositories and common international standards for describing and publishing your data, as well as guide you through the submission process.

_Note that data from human individuals might need special considerations when it comes to publishing._

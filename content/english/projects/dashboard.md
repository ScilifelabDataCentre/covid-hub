The visualizations on this page reflect how research on COVID-10 and SARS-CoV-2 has been developing in Sweden in terms of the publication output. Specifically, we plot various aspects of journal publications and preprints where at least one author has an affiliation with a Swedish research institute. The database of the publications themselves [can be found on this page](/publications/). Note that our database is manually curated and as such may not be exhaustive.

## Number of new publications

The graph displays the number of publications (including both journal publications and preprints) published each month as well as the cumulative total of publications per day. The dates reflect the preprint upload date or the official journal publication date, whichever is the most recent. A bump on the first day of each month appears due to that not every publication is published with a particular day of the month; all publications without a particular day of the month assigned are shown on the 1st day of that month.

## Most frequent words or phrases in the titles

This word cloud display most frequent words or phrases (where they make more sense) that appear in the titles of preprints or journal publications. Note that we have filtered out functional words (such as 'the', 'a', 'this', etc.) as well as words 'COVID-19' and 'SARS-CoV-2' since all publication titles contained those.

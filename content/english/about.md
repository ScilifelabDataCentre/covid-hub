The Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal provides information, guidelines, tools and services, in particular to support researchers in Sweden to utilise national and European infrastructures for data sharing. It is closely aligned with the European COVID-19 Data Platform hosted at EMBL-EBI, launched in April 2020.

The Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal is written and managed by the SciLifeLab Data Centre and partners.

The Swedish Research Council ([VetenskapsrÃ¥det](https://www.vr.se/)) and [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/) have signed the Wellcome Trust statement entitled [_"Sharing research data and findings relevant to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak"_](https://wellcome.ac.uk/coronavirus-covid-19/open-data).

This statement includes a number of points, including a commitment that signees ensure:

> _"researchers share interim and final research data relating to the outbreak, together with protocols and standards used to collect the data, as rapidly and widely as possible - including with public health and research communities and the WHO"._

The [Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal](/) provides information, guidelines, tools and services, in particular to support researchers in Sweden to utilise national and European infrastructures for data sharing.
It is closely aligned with the [European COVID-19 Data Platform](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/) hosted at EMBL-EBI, which was launched in April 2020.

The Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal is written and managed by the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/) and partners.

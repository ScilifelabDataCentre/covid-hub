The Swedish Research Council and SciLifeLab has signed the Wellcome Trust statement on
[Sharing research data and findings relevant to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak](https://wellcome.ac.uk/coronavirus-covid-19/open-data),
that among other things state that signees ensure that:

> _"researchers share interim and final research data relating to the outbreak, together with protocols and standards used to collect the data, as rapidly and widely as possible - including with public health and research communities and the WHO"._

The Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal provides information, guidelines, tools and services, in particular to support researchers in Sweden to utilise national and European infrastructures for data sharing. It is closely aligned with the European COVID-19 Data Platform hosted at EMBL-EBI, launched in April 2020.

The Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal is written and managed by the SciLifeLab Data Centre and partners.
